This project provides a convenient way to open multiple URLs simultaneously. It consists of three key components:

1. **`urls.txt`:** A plain text file containing a list of URLs, one per line.
2. **`url_opener.py`:** A Python script that iterates through the URLs in `urls.txt` and opens each URL in a web browser.
3. **`url_opener.bat` (Windows) or `url_opener.sh` (macOS/Linux):** A batch/shell script that executes the Python script with a single command.

**Features:**

* **Efficient URL Opening:** Opens multiple URLs concurrently, saving time and effort.
* **Customizable URL List:** Easily modify the `urls.txt` file to add or remove URLs.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems.
* **Simple to Use:** Execute the batch/shell script to initiate the URL opening process.

**How it Works:**

1. **Prepare the URL List:** Create or modify the `urls.txt` file with the desired URLs.
2. **Run the Script:** Execute the `url_opener.bat` or `url_opener.sh` script.
3. **Open URLs:** The Python script reads the URLs from the file and opens each URL in the default web browser.

**Benefits:**

* **Increased Productivity:** Streamlines the process of opening multiple web pages.
* **Time-Saving:** Avoids the need to manually open each URL individually.
* **Enhanced Workflow:** Simplifies tasks that involve visiting multiple websites.


**Note:**

This project provides a basic framework. You can further enhance it by adding features such as:

* Error handling and logging.
* Command-line arguments to customize behavior.
* A graphical user interface (GUI).

This project aims to be a valuable tool for anyone who deals with multiple URLs on a regular basis.
